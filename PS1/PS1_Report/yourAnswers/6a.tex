i. I have used anaalyze_channels.py to analyze the channels of the image. It turned out that the green channel most resembles grayscale conversion with highest correlation ($0.9128$). \\
ii. I found that this is because the green channel is more prevalent and widely used in the eye along with camera sensors. \\
iii. I am not sure if this phenomenon differs for other images, but at least the images I have tested, the result was the same.
