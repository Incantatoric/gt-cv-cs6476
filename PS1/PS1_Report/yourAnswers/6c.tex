i. The green channel (ps1-5-a-1) looked much more noisier.\\
ii. I believe this has to do with the result we have derived in 6a. The green channel is used the most by the eye and camera sensors. So adding noise to the green channel will be more noticeable.\\
iii. sigma = 25 was used. The green channel showed noise even with smaller sigma, but for the blue channel it started to show comparably visible noise with sigma = 100. The latter still seemed to affect the background the most.
