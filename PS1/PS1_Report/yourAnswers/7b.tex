i. I have chosen cutoff frequency = 5. At the given level 7, the cat image dominated at both near and far views. At 6, the dog started to appear only from very far awy. At 5, I was able to recognize cat at a close distance and dog at a far distance. At 4, the result looked increasingly dog-dominant even up close.\\
ii. It is as I have explained above. As the cutoff frequency decreased, the low-frequency dog image started to dominate. On the other hand, as the cutoff frequency increased, the high-frequency cat image started to dominate.
